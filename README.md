# About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Jamin Menter. I'm part of the San Diego-based Akluvis team, but I currently live in Utah.
I spend most of my time working on request management within VDC. 
I also work on some other domains like inventory, comments, and I've had a hand in lots of the GraphQL federation within VDC.

👀 In my personal time, I’m interested in Web3 tech such as p2p, federation, and blockchain. I also love play guitar 🎸 and snowboard 🏂.
